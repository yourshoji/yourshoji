### 🚀 Key Projects

#### 1. myESPFeeder-OOP 🐾🧮 | [View Repository](https://github.com/yourshoji/myESPFeeder-OOP)
An object-oriented rework of my previous **myESPFeeder** project, rewritten with a focus on cleaner structure and modular design.  
This version keeps the same functionality but improves code organization and maintainability.

* **What it does:** Automates feeding schedules and manual control using ESP32, RTC, LCD, and Blynk connectivity.  
* **Focus:** Demonstrates OOP principles in embedded system design for improved scalability and readability.  
* **Tech Stack:** `ESP32` • `C++ (OOP)` • `PlatformIO` • `Blynk` • `Servo` • `RTC Module` • `LCD`
<br><br>
#### 2. My Little Wish 🎮 | *Submission Build (3 weeks)* [View Website](https://yourshoji.itch.io/my-little-wish)
A psychological horror **walking simulator** focused on environmental storytelling, looping progression, and atmosphere, built with `Unity`.
* **My Contribution:** Core developer responsible for gameplay systems, loop structure, visual effects, audio integration, and overall implementation.
* **Key Systems I Built:**  
  `Gameplay Loop System`, `Jump Scare System & Manager`, `Door & Interaction Systems`, `Lighting & Atmosphere Systems`, `Ghost AI Behaviour`, `Audio Systems`, `Post-Processing & Visual Effects`
* **Additional Work:** Map implementation, environment decoration, AI-generated narrative assets, sound design and audio editing.
* **Tech Stack:** `Unity` • `C#`
<br><br>
#### 3. ESP32-TV-B-Gone 📺 | [View Repository](https://github.com/yourshoji/TV-B-Gone.ESP32)
A fork of the ESP8266 TV-B-Gone project, updated for ESP32 with a simpler design and modernized hardware.
* **What it does:** Fires the complete IR power-off code set in ~68 seconds with long-range output.
* **Simplified Hardware:** Full redesign using **TSAL6400** IR LEDs and an **IRLB8721** NMOS.
* **New Documentation:** Includes an updated circuit diagram, pin layout, and real-model build photos.
* **Straightforward Code:** Region switching removed for a cleaner setup focused on learning and reuse.
* **Tech Stack:** `ESP32` • `C++ (Arduino)` • `TSAL6400` • `IRLB8721`
<br><br>
#### 4. ESP-Scope (WROOM Port) 📈 | [View Repository](https://github.com/yourshoji/esp-scope-wroom32)
A high-stability, plug-and-play port of MatAtBread’s web-based oscilloscope, redesigned specifically for the **Classic ESP32 (WROOM-32D)**.

* **What it does:** Real-time signal visualization through a web browser using a 20kHz–83kHz sampling rate.
* **Architecture Fix:** Fully migrated from the original RISC-V (C6) design to **Xtensa hardware**, fixing driver crashes and board-init errors common in standard WROOM boards.
* **Stability Overhaul:** Solved "Black Screen" and "Silent Reboot" bugs by moving telemetry buffers to **Static RAM** and implementing **LRU socket recycling**.
* **Plug-and-Play:** Zero-config setup with a simplified ADC DMA driver and an auto-connecting WebSocket handshake.
* **Tech Stack:** `ESP32 (WROOM)` • `ESP-IDF` • `WebSockets` • `DMA ADC`
