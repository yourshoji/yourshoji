### 🚀 Key Projects

#### 1. myESPFeeder 🐾 | [View Repository](https://github.com/yourshoji/myESPFeeder)
A smart IoT pet feeder built on the ESP32 platform with Blynk integration.

* **What it does:** Supports remote or in-person feeding and scheduled feeding through Blynk.
* **Tech Stack:** `ESP32` • `C++ (Arduino)` • `Blynk` • `Servo` • `RTC Module` • `LCD`
<br>

#### 2. myESPFeeder-OOP 🐾🧮 | [View Repository](https://github.com/yourshoji/myESPFeeder-OOP)
An object-oriented rework of my previous **myESPFeeder** project, rewritten with a focus on cleaner structure and modular design.  
This version keeps the same functionality but improves code organization and maintainability.

* **What it does:** Automates feeding schedules and manual control using ESP32, RTC, LCD, and Blynk connectivity.  
* **Focus:** Demonstrates OOP principles in embedded system design for improved scalability and readability.  
* **Tech Stack:** `ESP32` • `C++ (OOP)` • `PlatformIO` • `Blynk` • `Servo` • `RTC Module` • `LCD`
<br>

#### 3. myShinEn 🎮 | [View Repository](https://github.com/yourshoji/myShinEn)
A collaborative point-and-click horror game built with `Godot`.

* **My Contribution:** I am the **Project Lead** on a small team, responsible for the core programming, game design, and project management.
* **Key Systems I Built:** `Inventory System`, `UI System & Design`, `4,Jumpscare System & Design`, `Map & Environment Design`, `Item Interaction System`, `Scene Transition System & Design`
* **Tech Stack:** `Godot` • `GDScript`
<br>

#### 4. ESP32-TV-B-Gone 📺 | [View Repository](https://github.com/yourshoji/TV-B-Gone.ESP32)
A fork of the ESP8266 TV-B-Gone project, updated for ESP32 with a simpler design and modernized hardware.

* **What it does:** Fires the complete IR power-off code set in ~68 seconds with long-range output.
* **Simplified Hardware:** Full redesign using **TSAL6400** IR LEDs and an **IRLB8721** NMOS.
* **New Documentation:** Includes an updated circuit diagram, pin layout, and real-model build photos.
* **Straightforward Code:** Region switching removed for a cleaner setup focused on learning and reuse.
* **Tech Stack:** `ESP32` • `C++ (Arduino)` • `TSAL6400` • `IRLB8721`
